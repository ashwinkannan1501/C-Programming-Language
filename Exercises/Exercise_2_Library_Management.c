/*
A library charges a fine for every book returned late.
For first 5 days the fine is 50 paise,
for 6-10 days fine is one rupee and
above 10 days fine is 5 rupees.
If you return the book after 30 days your membership will be cancelled.
Write a program to accept the number of days the member is late to return
the book and display the fine or the appropriate message.
