Features of C Programming Language :-
--------------------------------------
	C is a widely used language.
	It Provides many features that are given below :
(1) Simple
(2) Machine Independent (or) Portable
(3) Mid-level Programming Language
(4) Structured Programming Language 
(5) Rich Library
(6) Memory Management
(7) Fast Speed
(8) Pointers
(9) Recursion
(10) Extensible

Explanation from Point 5 :-

(5) Rich Library :- 
---------------------
	C Provides a lot of in-built functions that makes the development fast.

(6) Memory Management :- 
--------------------------
	It supports the features of dynamic memory allocation. In C Language, we can free the allocated memory at any time by calling the "free()" function

(7) Speed :- 
-------------
	The Compilation and Execution time of C Language is fast since there are lesser in-built functions and hence there are lesser overhead

(8) Pointers :- 
----------------
	C Provides the features of pointers. We can directly interact with the memory using pointers. We can use the pointers for memory, structures, functions, arrays, etc.,

(9) Recursion :- 
------------------
	In C, we can call the function within the function. It provides the code reusability for every function. Recursion enables us to use the approach of backtracking.

(10) Extensible :- 
-------------------
	C lannguage is extensible because it can adapt new features.
