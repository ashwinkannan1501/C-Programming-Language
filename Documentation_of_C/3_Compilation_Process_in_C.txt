Compilation Process in C :- 
-----------------------------

What is Compilation ? :-
-------------------------
	The Compilation is the process of converting the source code into the object code. 
	It gets done with the help of the compiler.
	First, The compiler checks the source code for the syntactical or structural error, and if the source code is error-free, then it generates the object code.

	The C Compilation process converts the source code taken as input into the object code (or) machine code

	The Pre-processor takes the source code as input, and it removes all the comments from the soure code.
	The Pre-processor takes the pre-processor directives and interprets it.
	For Example, if <stdio.h> directive is available in the program means, then the pre-processor interprets the directive and replace this directive with the content of 'stdio.h' file


        The Compilation process can be divided into 4 steps.
        (i) Pre-Processing
        (ii) Compiling
        (iii) Assembling and
        (iv) Linking
