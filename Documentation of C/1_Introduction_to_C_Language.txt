Introduction to C Language :- 
-------------------------------
    C Language Tutorial with programming approach for beginners and professionals , helps you to understand the C Language tutorial Easily
    
    The C Language is developed by Dennis Ritchie for creating system applications that directly interact with the hardware devices such as drivers kernels , etc 

    The C Programming is considered as the base for other programming languages, that is why it is known as mother language

    It can be defined by the following ways:
(i) Mother Language
(ii) System Programming Langugage
(iii) Procedure-Oriented Programming Langugage
(iv) Structured Programming Language
(v) Mid-level Programming Language

(i) C as a Mother Programming Language :-
--------------------------------------------
	The C Language is considered as the mother language of all moderan programming langugages because most of the compilers, JVM's, Kernels, etc., are written in C langugage and most of the programming languages follows C syntax , like C++, C#, Java, etc.,
	
	It Provides the core concepts like arrays, strings, functions, file handling, etc., that are being used in many langugages, like C++, C#, Java, Python, etc.,

(ii) C as a System Programming Language :- 
---------------------------------------------
	A System Programming Language is used to create a system software
	C Language is a system programming language because it can be used to do low-level programming (for example , driver and kernel)
	It is generally used to create hardware devices, OS, drivers, kernels, etc., 
	For Example, Linux Kernels are written in C
	It can't be used for internet programming like, Java, .NET, PHP, etc.,

(iii) C as a Procedural Language :- 
-------------------------------------
	A Procedure is known as function, method, routine, sub-routine, etc.,
	A Procedural language specifies a series of steps for a program to solve the problem.
	A Procesural language breaks the program into functions, data structures, etc.,
	C is a Procedural language. In C, variables and function prototypes must be declared before being used

(iv) C as a Structured Programming Language :- 
-------------------------------------------------	
	A Structured Programming Language is a subset of procedural language. 
	Structure means to break a program into parts or blocks, so that it may be easy to understand.
	In the C Language, we break the program into parts using functions. It makes the program easier to understand and modify.

(v) C as a mid-level Programming Language :-
----------------------------------------------
	C is considered as a mid-level programming language because it supports the feature of both low-level and high-level languages.
	C Program is converted into assembly code, it supports pointer arithmetic (low-level), but it is machine in-dependent (a feature of high-level).
	

Note :- A Low-Level language is specific to one machine i.e machine dependent
	A High-level language is not specific to one machine. i.e machine independent
